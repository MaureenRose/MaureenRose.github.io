-Intro-
I made the background artwork because I wanted to show something original that can represent my aesthetic views.
"Smile." is a sort of life motto for me. It is everywhere in my social media pages and I thought it should be included in my portfolio page as well.
"Maurose" is my pen name that use for all my individual projects and username in social media. It is a sort of brand that I create for myself.

-Resume-
The second part is a bio about myself. My work experience, education, certifications, and co-curricular activities. I also included a personal statement so that whoever reads the page can know a bit more about my thinking process.

-Skills-
The third part listed down languages I speak and my main skills. Those are the skills that I want to promote and thus they are the ones I included.

-Portfolio-
My portfolio is probably very different from everyone else. The portfolio I show should somehow be related to my aspirations and that is why I decided to include my past work in making healthcare articles.
The breastfeeding article is special in that I have to create all the graphics myself. I wanted to give proof my illustration skills and that is why I placed the pictures in a carousell.
I used the code from a past workshop with CodeforAsia that was held by NUSSU Commit last year.

//Challenges
Other than that workshop, this is literally my first time working with html, css, and bootstrap. The tutorial video really helped but it still took me a while to familiarise myself with the code and understand why a certain property has to be included.
I managed to understand everything by searching online through different forums. My supervisor at work also helped me understand some of the code.

//Reflection
It has been a hard and confusing journey but I am glad and proud of what I produced. Certainly not the best but at least I have something that I can proudly say I made (mostly) myself.
